   Development log: Odd-Even Transposition Sort Optimization Project
   Names: Christianne Barry (CB), Jean Faustin (JF)

Nov 19th, 2021: CB and JF experimented with different flag optimizations for the odd-even transposition sorting algorithm and documented the
	results in the group progress report document. 
Nov 20th, 2021: NM compiled the groups optimizations of both Odd-Even and Bucket Sorts for the progress report.
Nov 27th, 2021: Group met to discuss distribution of the parallel optimizations of the two sorting algorithms. It was decided that CB and JF
	would produce the Odd Even Transposition Sort parallel optimizations for both OpenMP and MPI while the other group members NM and JL
	would optimize Bucket Sort.
Nov 29th, 2021: CB began optimizing Odd-Even Sort with OpenMP parallelization. Discussed parallelizing ideas with JF such as creating processes
	before outer loop to reduce fork-join overhead performance losses.
Dec 3rd, 2021: JF began optimizing Odd-Even Sort with MPI parallelization. NM compiled and summarized the groups data and algorithms so
	far into a 5 min video for the class discussion board.
Dec 5th, 2021: Having successfully compiled Odd-Even Sort we began to collect data on the schedule optimizations, flag optimizations, and
	analysis of the problem size and num_cores using cs-ssh.
