Nov 14th, 2021: All group members met to discuss project.  Agreed upon 2d heat equation and created project description
                document.
Nov 15th, 2021: JL and NM met to pair program a sequential implementation of the 2d heat equation.  Received feedback on
                topic from Dr. Srinvasan that project was not complex enough. Group members decided to do additional
                research into alternative topics and discuss in the following days.
Nov 16th, 2021: NM completed research on potential sorting algorithms and presented resources to the group.
Nov 18th, 2021: JL and NM pair-programmed sequential implementations of the odd/even and sample sorting algorithms.
